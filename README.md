# Data Science

Added some projects to show my skills:
1) # NLP
NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the ability of machines to read, understand, and make sense of human languages. Here are some examples of projects in this field.

2) # Neural networks
A neural network is a group of interconnected units called neurons that send signals to one another. Neurons can be either biological cells or mathematical models. While individual neurons are simple, many of them together in a network can perform complex tasks. There are two main types of neural network. In neuroscience, a biological neural network is a physical structure found in brains and complex nervous systems – a population of nerve cells connected by synapses. 

These are three implementations of different neural networks.
